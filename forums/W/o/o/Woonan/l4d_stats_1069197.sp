LEFT 4 DEAD STATS - SOURCEMOD PLUGIN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Written By msleeper (c) 2009
Visit http://www.msleeper.com/ for more info!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customization to Support Multiple Gamemodes And L4D2 By muukis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a ranking/stat tracking system for Left 4 Dead Co-op. It will track
certain actions, such as giving a teammate Pills or rescuing them from a
Hunter, as well as tracking kills of the types of Infected. The goal of the
stats is both to rank players against one another, but also to promote
teamwork by awarding more points for completing team-specific goals rather
than simply basing on kills.

You can access your basic rank information by typing "rank" or "/rank" in
the chat area. You can access the Top 10 Players by typing "top10" or
"/top10" in the chat area.

The plugin ONLY works in Co-op mode, in every difficulty but Easy. Stats
will automatically stop tracking if any of these conditions are met:
 . Game is in Easy difficulty
 . sv_cheats is set to "1"
 . There are not enough Human players, as determined by a Cvar
 . The Database connection has failed

The webstats portion provides more in-depth stat information, both for
individual players as well as the server as a whole, with full campaign and
map stat info. More information about webstats can be found in the webstats
ZIP file.

Special thanks to DopeFish, Icettiflow, jasonfrog, and liv3d for helping me
beta test prior to full public release.

Thank you and enjoy!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little notice on my behalf as well:

I'd like to send my special thanks to Harm and Titan for the testing done
when adding support to L4D2. This would not have been possible to accomplish
in this timeframe, if it wasn't for them! Planetsize thanks guys!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version History

-- 0.1.0 (1/8/09)
 . Initial closed beta release!

-- 0.1.1 (1/9/09)
 . Silenced plugin disable alerts, except "not enough Human players" alert.
 . Removed misc debug message.
 . Fixed misc error log messages.

-- 0.1.2 (1/12/09)
 . Testing new interstitial SQL method for Common Infected kill tracking.
   Instead of sending a SQL transaction after each kill, only send SQL during
   the update period when Common Infected points are displayed. The high
   amount of SQL traffic causes noticible lag during high combat periods,
   such as when a mob attacks.

-- 0.1.6 (1/13/09)
 . Fully implimented interstitial SQL update for Common Infected. Added
   check to send update when a player disconnects, so no points are lost if
   they disconnect between interstitial updates.
 . Cleaned up code a bit.
 . Improved player name sanitation.
 . Changed new players playtime to init at 1 instead of 0.
 . Changed point amounts from static values to Cvar values.
 . Added Cvar to control how stats messages are displayed to players:
    0 = Stats messages are off
    1 = Messages sent to the player who earned them only
    2 = Same as 1, but Headshots on Special Infected are globally anounced
    3 = All messages are global. Warning: This is VERY annoying!
 . Added Cvar to control whether Medkit points are given based on the amount
   healed, or a static amount set by Cvar. Amount healed is 0.5x in Normal,
   1x in Advanced, and 2x in Expert.
 . Added check to disable stats if the Database connection has failed.

-- 0.1.8 (1/15/09)
 . Further cleaned up code.
 . Optimized UTF8 character support.
 . Removed log message on successful database connection.
 . Added threaded query to player inserting, to check if the player already
   exists and if so, don't attempt to INSERT IGNORE them.
 . Reformatted rank panels.
 . Added Cvar to list community site for more information in "rank" panel.
 . Removed table generation from the plugin. This will be handled by a
   setup script provided with webstats.

-- 0.1.9 (1/16/09)
 . Changed all updates to threaded queries, to fix lag caused by updates and
   server timeouts in rare cases.

-- 1.0.0 (1/18/09)
 . Initial public release!

-- 1.1.0 (1/25/09)
 . Fixed change in update/Common Infected announcement timer not obeying
   changes to the cvar, except when in the config file and the plugin/server
   is restarted.
 . Fixed team chat not picking up chat triggers.
 . Added invalid database connection checking to rank/top10 panel display.
 . Fixed bug where players would be inserted into the database, but their
   user data would not get updated and they would appear blank.
 . Removed plugin version from showing up in the config file.
 . Removed "Not enough Humans" message when in Versus.
 . Made rank panel display after client connect at the start of each map,
   and added cvar to enable/disable this.
 . Made "Playtime" display hours if the playtime is longer than 60 minutes.
 . Added cvar to hide the display of public chat triggers.
-- 1.1.1 (4/22/09)
 . Changed "IsVersus()" function to "InvalidGameMode()" to fix deadstop bug
   with the Survival update. This is part of paving the way to Survival
   and Versus stats in a future release.
 . Fixed various error messages in error logs.
 . Fixed stats panel to now work properly for people with certain characters
   in their name not making it display.
 . Fixed (again) a certain case where blank users would be inserted.
 . Added cvar to enable/disable showing of the rank panel when not in a valid
   gamemode, showing of disabled messages, and letting players use the chat
   commands.
 . Added some stat whoring checks to the plugin:
    . A maximum amount of points can be earned in a single map
    . Only 3 Tanks may be awarded during a single map
 . Fixed minor bug with Healthpack point award not giving full amount.
 . Added a few currently unused cvars for future features:
   . sm_l4dstats_dbprefix -- Prefix to be used for database tables
   . sm_l4dstats_enablecoop -- Enable stats for Coop mode
   . sm_l4dstats_enablesv -- Enable stats for Survival mode
   . sm_l4dstats_enableversus -- Enable stats for Versus mode
   . sm_l4dstats_leaderboardtime -- Duration in days to show players top
     times on the Survival leaderboards

-- 1.1.1C (8/19/09) Customized by muukis
 . Added support for custom maps.

-- 1.2AXXX (9/23/09) Alpha versions from Versus support
 . Started implementing the Versus support. (IT COMPILES!!!1)

-- 1.2BXXX (10/16/09) Beta versions from Versus support
 . All new major features that I could come up with are now implemeted:
   . Survivor friendly fire cooldown mode.
   . Survivor medkit use penalty (score reduction.)
   . Spam protection allowing team gain and loss information to be shown
     for the team only.
   . Infected score:
     . General: Damage done to the survivors.
     . General: Damage done by normal infected is forwarded to the specials
       that have influence over the victim (blinded, lunged or paralyzed.)
     . General: Incapacitate and kill a survivor.
     . Hunter pounces.
     . Boomer blindings.
     . Tank rock sniper.
